# homework-12
The product that i plan to release into this world is a poetry book. I have been a poet for a couple years and have
recently gotten a poem accepted into a literary magazine. I plan on using my poetry to make a book that writers and
poetry enthusiasts can use to help them begin taking the steps to creative thinking, and illustrating theyre lives with words.
The steps i need to take are to 1. Talk to a publisher about sending in a transcript, and 2. To make the time to advertise my 
writing and get my name into a bigger base.
